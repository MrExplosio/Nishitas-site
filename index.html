   <h2>  HOBBIES </h2>
    <h4>Number 1: Craft</h4>
   <p> As per 2024, Nishita is really fond of crafts and arts. She likes making all sorts of stuff, like bookmarks,pencil stands, etc. The bad thing is that she never cleans up and wastes a lot of paper unnessacarily. She still learns alot from YT channels about crafts. So uh yeah, thats it for crafts. </p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h4>Number 2: Drawing </h4>
   <p>Nishita is also very fond of drawing, she makes alot of them. For example: Scenaries, Princesses, etc. She very rarely watches YT channels about drawing. She always uses plain, single-sided paper instead of drawing books.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Number 3: Shopping </h4>
  <p> Nishita really likes to shop. Whenever our family goes outside on a trip, she buys at least 4 items. She mostly likes to buy cute stuff, and drawing and craft related items.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h4>Number 4: Crying</h4>
  <p>She really, for some unknown reason, likes to cry. For like everything! For example: She didnt complete a project that is unnessacary. and: 'We didnt buy anything from the airport! I DONT CARE THAT ITS 5X EXPENSIVE" and stuff like that.</p>
